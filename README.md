# WS28xx RGB LED SPI Driver

This crate is a driver for WS28XX (WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, WS2818) RGB LED chains/strips. They are also known as "NeoPixel" devices or "Smard LEDs".
 
### Wait, there are already so many drivers for WS2811/WS2812 on crates.io?
At the beginning I was not aware of that WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, ..., WS2818 are basically the same. I just did not notice it. I though I'm having WS2818 LEDs and
there wasn't a driver for that specific product with WS2818 in its name.
See this links to learn about the differences:
- https://www.alldatasheet.com/view.jsp?Searchword=WS2818
- https://www.witop-tech.com/what-is-the-difference-ws2818-vs-ws2811-usc1903-magic-color-digital-led-strip/
- https://www.sdiplight.com/what-is-ws2818-and-how-to-use-ws2818/

It seems like all of them work use the same protocol, tho. That means this driver probably works for all of them.

 
### About this driver
It's a **simple, stripped down, educational example** how to bring your LEDs to life. This [0] is an example device with chained WS2818 RGB LEDs that can be used with this driver.
This driver only works on Linux systems with a SPI device, like Raspberry Pi [1]. This is needed because my driver operates at
15.6MHz. This is required because I need to reach specific *timings in nanoseconds* according to the specification while sending data [2].
WS28xx LEDs use a one wire protocol without a clock, therefore the timings during data transmission are important.

The SPI device in your Raspberry Pi has a reliable clock with high frequencies available. Regular GPIO pins 
**won't work!** Toggling GPIO pins takes 1Âµs (in my testing) which is *WAY TOO SLOW!* Therefore I use SPI.
There is a clock device in hardware - much more reliable!

Find the `MOSI`-Pin on your device (e.g. Raspberry Pi) and connect it with `DIN`-Port of the LED. That's all what's needed.

Have a look into the examples/code for further explications. :)

**There is no warranty that this will work on your setup! High frequency stuff is complicated!**

### Examples
See https://github.com/phip1611/ws2818-rgb-led-spi-driver/tree/master/examples. 

```rust
use ws2818_rgb_led_spi_driver::encoding::{encode_rgb};
use ws2818_rgb_led_spi_driver::adapter::WS28xxAdapter;

fn main() {
    println!("make sure you have \"SPI\" on your Pi enabled and that MOSI-Pin is connected with DIN-Pin!");
    let mut adapter = WS28xxAdapter::new("/dev/spidev0.0").unwrap();

    // Method 1: encode first and write in two step (prefered way; better performance)
    {
        let mut spi_encoded_rgb_bits = vec![];
        // set first three pixels to bright red, bright green and bright blue
        spi_encoded_rgb_bits.extend_from_slice(&encode_rgb(255, 0, 0));
        spi_encoded_rgb_bits.extend_from_slice(&encode_rgb(0, 255, 0));
        spi_encoded_rgb_bits.extend_from_slice(&encode_rgb(0, 0, 255));
        adapter.write_encoded_rgb(&spi_encoded_rgb_bits).unwrap();
    }

    // Method 2: encode and write in one step
    {
        let mut rgb_values = vec![];
        // set first three pixels to bright red, bright green and bright blue
        rgb_values.push((255, 0, 0));
        rgb_values.push((0, 255, 0));
        rgb_values.push((0, 0, 255));
        adapter.write_rgb(&rgb_values).unwrap();
    }
}
```
